# Setup

You need to have HACS already installed on your Home Assistant instance and you will need to know your way around .yaml file for integrate this.

There is no HACS integration as this is my own home dashboard. 

Prerequisites for custom integration can be found on the [Custom Integration Requirement page](https://avenger11.github.io/HomeOS-doc/pages/Custom%20integration%20required.html)
